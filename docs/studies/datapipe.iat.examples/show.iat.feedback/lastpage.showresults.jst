<b>Thank you very much for your participation.</b>
<br/><br/>

    In this study, we measured your automatically-activated associations between the concepts '<%=category1%>' and '<%=category2%>' with the concepts '<%=att1%>' and '<%=att2%>'. 
	Your automatically-activated association might be different than the association that you explicitly endorse. 	
	For instance, you might consciously associate '<%=category1%>' with the concept '<%=att2%>', 
	but show an automatic association of '<%=category1%>' with '<%=att1%>'.<br/>
	To measure your automatically-activated association, we used the Implicit Association Test (the IAT). 
	Here are your results:
	</p>
	<b><%= global.raceiat.feedback %></b>
	<br/><br/>

	<p class='lead'><b>Disclaimer:</b><br/>
	These results are not a definitive assessment of your automatically-activated associations. 
	The results may be influenced by variables related to the test 
	(e.g., the category labels or particular items used to represent the categories on the IAT) 
	or the person (e.g., how tired you are). 
	The results are provided for educational purposes only.</p>

	<p class='lead'><b>How Does The IAT Work?</b></p>
	<p class='lead'>The IAT measures the strength of associations between concepts 
	(e.g., <%=category1%>, <%=category2%>) and attributes (e.g., <%=att1%>, <%=att2%>). 
	The main idea is that making a response is easier when 
	closely related items share the same response key. 
	We would say that one has an automatically activated association of 
	<%=category1%> with <%=att1%> and <%=category2%> with <%=att2%> 
	if they are faster to categorize items 
	when <%=category1%> and <%=att1%> share a response key 
	relative to when <%=category2%> and <%=att1%> share a response key. <br/><br/>
	Many researchers consider associations of Black and White people with 
	the concepts Good and Bad an estimate of 
	automatic preference between Black and White people. 
	An automatic preference is your very first preference betweens people, groups, or other objects. 
	An automatic preference might be activated even if people do not endorse that preference. 
	<br/><br/>
	Any single IAT is unlikely to predict behavior well for a specific individual. 
	In the aggregate, the IAT can predict behavior 
	such as discrimination in hiring and promotion, medical treatment, 
	and decisions related to criminal justice. </p>

	<p class='lead'><b>Does The Order In Which I Took The IAT Matter?</b></p>
	<p class='lead'>Yes, the order in which you take the IAT can influence your overall results. 
	But, the effect is very small. 
	So if you first pair <%=category1%> + <%=att1%> / <%=category2%> + <%=att2%> 
	and then pair <%=category1%> + <%=att2%> / <%=category2%>  + <%=att1%>, 
	your results might be a just a tiny bit different 
	than they would be if you had done the reverse pairing first. 
	To minimize the order effect, we give more practice trials 
	before the second pairing than we did before the first pairing. 
	We also randomly assign participants to one of the two possible orderings, 
	so half of the test-takers complete 
	<%=category1%> + <%=att1%> / <%=category2%> + <%=att2%> 
	and then <%=category1%> + <%=att2%> / <%=category2%>  + <%=att1%>, 
	and the other half get the opposite order.</p>
